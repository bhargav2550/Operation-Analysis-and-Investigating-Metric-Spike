# APPROACH:
1) I gather the information from the description provided i.e., which tasks I need
to complete.
2) Using MYSQL Workbench I created new files and I started writing my queries
to achieve the result.
3) Later I executed the Queries and if there are any errors in the code, I modified
the code and fixed the code without any errors.
4) I Revised the code once after completion of execution.
5) Finally, I attached my code to the file.
# TECH STACK USED:
❖ SQL
❖ Development tool – MYSQL Workbench version 8.0.30.
The main purpose of using MySQL workbench is that it provides the console to
simply editable and administer the MYSQL environments and to gain better
results and insights of the data. It provides data modeling, SQL development and
connecting servers and is the best tool to design, generate and manage the
databases.
